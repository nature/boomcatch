# mappers/waterfall

The waterfall mapper transforms resource timing data into an HTML document containing an [SVG] waterfall chart, similar to the waterfall charts that can be found in many web browser developer tools.

It accepts two options, `svgTemplate` (`-T` from the command line), which allows you to specify a path to a [handlebars] template that will be rendered with the data, and `svgSettings` (`-S` from the command line), which enables you to override some of the visual aspects of the waterfall chart, including size, colours and padding.

This mapper also exports a data type, `'html'`, for use by forwarders.
