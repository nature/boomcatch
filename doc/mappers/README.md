# Mappers

Mappers are the third stage of the [extension pipeline][extensions], called after [validators] and [filters] but before [forwarders]. Their purpose is to transform beacon data into an appropriate format to be consumed by some other process.

The choice of mapper can be specified at the command line, using the `-m` [option]. Five mappers are available out-of-the-box, [statsd], [statsd-npg], [har], [waterfall] and [unmapped].

Defining custom mappers is simple. The [source code for the statsd mapper][src] should be easy to follow, but the basic pattern is to export an interface that looks like this:

```javascript
{
	initialise: function (options) {
	}
}
```

Where `initialise` is a function that takes an options object and returns the mapper function, bound to any pertinent options. The signature for the returned mapper function should look like this:

```javascript
function (/* bound options, ... */ data, referer, userAgent, remoteAddress) {
}
```

The remaining/unbound arguments passed to the mapper are, in order:

1. `data`: Filtered data.
2. `referer`: URL of the page that sent the beacon request.
3. `userAgent`: User agent string of the client that sent the beacon request.
4. `remoteAddress`: IP address of the client that sent the beacon request.

The result of the mapper function should be a string containing the mapped data.

In addition to the `initialise` function, mappers may optionally expose a `separator` property, which can be used by forwarders to ensure sane data-chunking behaviour in the event that they are required to break data across multiple packets before sending it on. For example, the `statsd` mapper defines `separator` as `'\n'`.
