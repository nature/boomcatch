# Extensions

Boomcatch provides four extension points,which are invoked as a pipeline when a beacon reques tis received. Those extension points,in order of invocation, are:

1. [Validators]: These functions are predicates, which can check that the request meets your specific requirements, then signal whether to continue processing or fail the request.

2. [Filters]: These functions filter out unwanted parts of the data before it is passed to the mapper.

3. [Mappers]: These functions transform the data into a format suitable for consumption by some other process.

4. [Forwarders]: These functions conclude processing by sending the mapped data onto another process.

In each case, extensions are loaded with `require`, employing a two-pass approach to enable loading of custom extensions. The first attempt is made with the relevant extension directory prefixed to the module path. If that attempt throws, a second attempt is made using the specified module path verbatim. Thus, standard extensions will be loaded on the first attempt and custom extensions will be loaded on the second.
