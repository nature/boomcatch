# forwarders/file

The file forwarder writes data to the file system. It accepts one option: `fwdDir` (`-D` on the command line).

* `fwdDir`: Directory to write data to.

Each beacon request is written to a separate file in the nominated directory.

If the active [mapper] has specified a data type, this will be used to set an appropriate file extension.

This forwarder is currently very rudimentary and has no awareness of file system limits regarding the maximum number of files per directory. The generated file names contain a [UUID] to avoid naming clashes.
